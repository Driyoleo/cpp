~ String 

# defination 
- C++ strings are sequences of characters stored in a char array. 
- Strings are used to store words and text. They are also used to store data, such as numbers and other types of information.
- Strings in C++ can be defined either using the std::string class or the C-style character arrays.

# c-style string 
- These strings are stored as the plain old array of characters terminated by a null character ‘\0’.
- syntax :
    1. char str[] = "hello" ;
    .. (or)
    2. char str[] = {'h','e','l','l','o','\0'} ;
       cout << str ;
    .. output :
        hello 
- note :
    - in first case , total char in the arr are 6 including '\0' at last by default 
    - in second case , we need to insert manually '\0' at the end , if not then while cout it will provide the string 
      times..
      eg. hellohello
    - both of them type is .. A<len>_c , eg. A6_c
    - '\0' it is a special character , null 

# std::string Class
- These are the new types of strings that are introduced in C++ as std::string class defined inside <string> header file.
- This provides many advantages over conventional C-style strings such as dynamic size, member functions, etc.
- syntax :
    string str("hello") ;
    cout << str ;
    .. output :
        hello
- note : 
    - it's data type is NSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE
    - one more way to declare if we want to print more times only one character
        string str(number , character);
        eg. string str(5 , 'g') ;
        .. output :
            ggggg
