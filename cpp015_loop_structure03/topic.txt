~ break and continue

# defination (break)
- Break statement is used to break the loop or switch case statements execution and brings the control to the next block of code after
  that particular loop or switch case it was used in.

# defination (continue)
- The continue statement is used inside loops in C++ language. When a continue statement is encountered inside the loop, the control
  jumps to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration, skipping the execution of statements inside the body of the loop after the
  continue statement.
