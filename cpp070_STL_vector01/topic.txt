~ vector 

# about 
- Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
- it has a dynamic size which changes as per requirement

# pros 
- fast to random access
- sequenced 
- reduce expensive code

# how to create vector
- 1. vector <data_type> vector_name ;
    - creates vector with zero size of given data_type

- 2. vector <data_type> vector_name(3) ;
    - creates vector with size 3 of given data_type
    
- 3. vector <data_type> vector_name(vector_ofsamedatatype) ;
    - creates another vector with same size and elements
    
- 4. vector <data_type> vector_name(size , element) ;
    - creates vector of size given with one element
