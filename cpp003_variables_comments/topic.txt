~ comments 

# defination 
- A comment is a human-readable text in the source code, which is ignored by the compiler. Comments can be used to insert any informative piece which a programmer does not wish to be executed. It could be either to explain a piece of code or to make it more readable. In addition, it can be used to prevent the execution of alternative code when the process of debugging is done.
Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.

# single line comment
- defined as // before any set of characters
- eg. // this is a single line comment

# multiple line comment
- defined within /* and  */
- eg. /* this
         is 
         A
         multi 
         line 
         comment
      */
