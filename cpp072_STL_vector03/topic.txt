~ element access member function

# member functions
- operator[]
- at
- front
- back 
- data

# operator :
- returns the element at the index given
- syntax :
    vector_name[index] ;

# at
- similar to operator[]
- syntax :
    vector_name.at(index) ;

# front
- it returns the element at the front
- syntax :
    vector_name.front() ;

# back
- it returns the element at the back 
- syntax :
    vector_name.back() ;

# data
- A pointer to the first element in the array used internally by the vector 
- syntax :
    data_type * pointer_name = vector_name.data() ;

# note :
- using these functions we can only access element upto the vector size
- through this we can not increase or decrease the size of vector
- thus it is better to use them for :
    - get the element 
    - change the element
    only..
