# functions 
- push_back() 
- pop_back()
- insert()
- erase()
- swap()
- clear()

# push_back()
- it add given element at the end 
- along with it increases the size of the vector
- syntax
    vector_name.push_back(element) ;

# pop_back()
- it delete the last element in a vector
- along with it it decreases the size of the vector
- syntax 
    vector_name.pop_back() ;

# insert()
- it add a element at a given place with a element of given number of times
- along with it increases the size of the vector 
- syntax 
    vector_name.insert(vector_iterator , number_of_times , element) ;

# erase() 
- it delete a element if one argument is given that is position(vector_iterator)
- or a range of elements if two argument given that is starting and ending iterator 
- it decreases the size of the vector 
- syntax 
    vector_name.erase(position_iterator) ;
    or ..
    vector_name.erase(starting_iterator , ending_iterator) ;

# swap() 
- it exhange the content between two vector
- syntax 
    vec1.swap(vec2) ;

# clear()
- it delete all the elements of the vector
- make the size of the vector 0 
- syntax
    vector_name.clear() ;
