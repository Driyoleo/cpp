# about 
- oop stands for object oriented programing .
-  Programming with object-oriented concepts aims to emulate real-world concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc, in
   a program. 

# need 
- improve readability of code
- provide reuseability of code
- ensure data security
- helps in maintance of code

# terminologies 
- classes : Basic template for creating objects.
- Objects – Basic run-time entities and instances of a class
- Data Abstraction & Encapsulation – Wrapping data and functions into a single unit which makes the code simple and meaningful known as
                                     data abstraction
- Inheritance – Properties of one class can be inherited into others
- Polymorphism – Ability to take more than one form
- Dynamic Binding – Code which will execute is not known until the program runs
- Message Passing – message (Information) call format
