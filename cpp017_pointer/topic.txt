~ pointer

# defination 
- simple : it is variable which stores the address of other variable
- A pointer is a data type that holds the address of another data type. A pointer itself is a variable that points to any other variable
  It can be of type int, char, array, function, or even any other pointer. Pointers in C++ are defined using the ‘*’ (asterisk) operator.

# syntax 
- <data type>* <pointer_variable> = &<addressed_variable>
- eg. 
    int* b = &a ;
    - here b is the pointer of address of a 

# operators
- & : address of operator
- * : dereference operator

# address of operator
- it give the address of any variable 
- syntax :
    &<variable>
- eg. 
    cout << "address of num is : " << &num ;

# dereference operator
- it gives the value at the address hold by a pointer 
- eg. 
    cout << "value at the address hold by the pointer b : " *b ;
