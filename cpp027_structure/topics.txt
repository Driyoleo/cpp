~ structure 

# need 
- For dealing with cases where there is a requirement to store dissimilar data types, C++ provides a data type called â€˜structureâ€™. 

# defination
- The structure is a user-defined data type that is available in C++.
- Structures are used to combine different types of data types, just like an array is used to combine the same type of data types .

# syntax :
    - step 1 : define structure in global 
                    struct <structure_name>{
                        // define variables for it
                    };
    - step 2 : use it in main 
                    struct <structure_name> <structure_variable> ;
                    structure_variable.<variables> = value ;
# eg.. 
    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std ;

    struct student
    {
        int age ;
        char grade ;
    };

    int main(){
        struct student abhinav ;
        abhinav.age = 12 ;
        abhinav.grade = 'A' ;
        cout << "age is "<< abhinav.age << " and grade is " << abhinav.grade << " of abhinav given ." ;
        return 0 ;
    }
