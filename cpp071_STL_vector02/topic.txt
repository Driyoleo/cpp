~ capacity member functions

# mostly used capacity member functions are :
- size() 
- empty()

# size() 
- it returns the size of the vector
- syntax :
    vector_name.size(int) ;

# empty() 
- it returns bool value after checking it's size is zero or not
- syntax :
    vector_name.empty() ;
- note :    
    - if true : 1 
    - if false : 0 

# capacity :
- Returns the size of the storage space currently allocated for the vector, expressed in terms of elements.
- syntax :
    vector_name.capacity() ;
- note :
    - when we increase size by push_back or resize() it also increses
    - but while decreasing the size with resize() it remains the same

# resize
- Resizes the container so that it contains n elements
- syntax :
    vector_name.resize() ;

# shrink_to_fit()
- it makes the size and capacity of the vector same
- syntax :
    vector_name.shrink_to_fit() ;
