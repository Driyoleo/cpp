~ ambiguity resolution in inheritance

# what is ambiguity ?
- when there is any confused situtation between the base classes and derived classes with same member or method it is called ambiguity of
  inheritance

# cases of ambiguity 

    case 1 : same member or method in both base classes 
        - then we have to resolve that ambiguity by ...

            1. for ambiguity in member 
                data_type member_name = base_class_name :: member_name ;

            2. for ambiguity in method 
                data_type method_name(parameters){
                    base_class_name :: method_name(parameters);
                }

    case 2 : same member or method in base class and derived class 
        - no need of resolution is there cause the member or method in the derived class will overwrite the member or method
