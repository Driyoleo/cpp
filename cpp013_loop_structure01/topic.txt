~ loop structure 

# importance 
- these type of structure is important when a repitative work comes 
- it helps in code reduction
- simplification of code
- reduce time complexibility of the code

# diff loop structure 
- 1. for loop 
- 2. while loop
- 3. do while loop

~ for loop 

# syntax 
- for ( initialisation , condition , stepping ){
    statement ;
  }

# eg. 
    for ( int i ; i < 6 ; i++){
        cout << i << endl ;
    }
    - output : 
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5

# note 
- unlike python it can be infinite if condition is always true
