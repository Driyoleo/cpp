~ output and input methods 

- C++ language comes with different libraries, which help us in performing input/output operations. In C++, sequences of bytes corresponding to input and output are commonly known as streams.
- but we will mainly use iostream..

# iostream 
- it is a header file which includes the output and input operations
- it's full form is .. input output stream
- input stream : In the input stream, the direction of the flow of bytes occurs from the input device (for ex keyboard) to the main memory.
- output stream : In the output stream, the direction of flow of bytes occurs from the main memory to the output device (for ex-display)

# insertion operator .. <<  .. used in cout 
# extraction operator .. >> .. used in cin
