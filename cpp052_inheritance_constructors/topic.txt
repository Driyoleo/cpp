~ constructors in inheritance

# way of declaration constructor in derived class 
- if there is no argument in base class constructor 
    derived_class_name(argument){};

- if there is argument in base class constructor
    derived_class_name(int arg1 , int arg2 , int arg3) : base1_name(arg2) , base2_name(arg3){} ;

# order of execution 
- first base class constructors will be called then constructor of derived class is called
- base class constructors will be called in the order of declaration inheritance
    eg.
        class D : public A , public B{} ;
    - order of execution --> A() --> B() --> D() 
- if there is any virtual base class is present then there constructors will be called first in order
    eg. 
        class D : public A , virtual public B{} ;
    - order of execution --> B --> A --> D
