~ I/O file : input and output 

# about 
- the work with a file inside a directory is done with the help of header file fstream
- it is important for those work which needs to save data for work 
- for output from a file : ofstream class is used
- for input from a file : ifstream class is used 

# ofstream 
- syntax 
    ofstream out("<filepath>") ;
    out << "text to be inserted in the file" ;
- note :
    - it will open the file and make it accessible for writing in it
    - if the file is not present it will create a new file in that path
    - if the file already exist then also it creates a new file of same name and overwrite on that

# ifstream
- syntax 
    string str ;
    ifstream in("<filepath>") ;
    in >> str ; or.. getline(in,str) ;
- note :
    - it will open the file and make it accessible for reading 
    - if the file is not present it will give a blank file or nothing
    - difference btw in and getline :   
        - in will return will read data separated with space or newline
            eg..
                in >> data1 >> data2 ;
                cout << data1 << " " << data2 << endl ;

            output :
                hello world  
        - getline will give a whole line means data upto a new line
            eg.. 
                getline(in , data1 ) ;
                cout << data1 << endl ;

            output :
                hello world 
        - in results in forwarding pointer just after the previous data 
            eg..
                in >> data1 >> data2 >> data3;
                cout << data1 << " " << data2 << " " << data3 << endl ;
                getline(in , data1 ) ;
                cout << data1 << endl ;
            
            output :
                hello world i
                 am new here 
        - getline results in forwarding the pointer to next line
            eg.. 
                getline(in , data1 ) ;
                cout << data1 << endl ;
                getline(in , data1 ) ;
                cout << data1 << endl ;    

            output :
                hello world 
                i am new here
