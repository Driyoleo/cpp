~ inheritance

# what is  inheritance 
- the concept of reusability in c++ is through inheritance
- we can reuse the properties of existing class by inheritance 
- the existing class is called base class
- and the new class which is inherited is called derived class 

# need 
- reusing class save time and money 
- helps to follow DRY ( don't repeat yourself) in coding 
- resuing of tested code will save lot of efforts in debugging of a new code

# types of inheritance 
- single inheritance : one base class and one derived class
- multiple inheritance : multiple base class and one derived class 
- hierarchical inheritance : one base class and multiple derived class 
- multilevel inheritance : chain of single inheritance
- hybrid inheritance : mixed chain of multilevel and  multiple inheritance 

# some related flow charts of inheritance types are given in this folder
