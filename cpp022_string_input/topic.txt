~ taking input in strings

# ways of taking input in strings
- cin
- getline
- stringstream

# cin 
- most simple and used way to take input of string
- syntax : 
    cin >> variable ;
- example :
    string str ;
    cout << "enter your name : " ;
    cin >> str ;
    cout << "nice to meet you " << str <<"." ;
    
    .. output :
        enter your name : Driyo
        nice to meet you Driyo.

# getline 
- The getline() function in C++ is used to read a string from an input stream.
- syntax :
    getline( cin , <variable> ) ;
- example : 
    string str ;
    cout << "enter your name : " ;
    getline( cin , str ) ;
    cout << "have a good day .." << str ; 

    .. output :
        enter your name : Driyo
        have a good day ..Driyo

# stringstream 
- The stringstream class in C++ is used to take multiple strings as input at once.
- operates mainly on spaces
- syntax :
    stringstream <object>(string) ;
- example :
    stringstream obj("hi i am robo") ;
    string temp ;
    while (obj >> temp){
        cout << temp << endl ;
    }

    .. output :
        enter your name : Driyo
        have a good day ..Driyo
        hi
        i
        am
        robo


# difference between string and array of characters 

String

- Strings define objects that can be represented as string streams.	
- No Array decay occurs in strings as strings are represented as objects.	
- A string class provides numerous functions for manipulating strings.	
- Memory is allocated dynamically.	

Character Array

- The null character terminates a character array of characters.
- The threat of array decay is present in the case of the character array 
- Character arrays do not offer inbuilt functions to manipulate strings.
- The size of the character array has to be allocated statically.
